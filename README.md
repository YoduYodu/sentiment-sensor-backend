## Log
#### OCT 6
* Initialize project

#### OCT 14, 15
* Grabs all the text file.
* Split the source dataset into train and test, 10% for validation
* Initialize the model, get the learning rate plot.
* Train the model, fine tune it, and save the fine-tuned encoder.
* Train another model classifier using the saved encoder and train the model 4 times.
* Save the model(model.pth) for future use.

#### OCT 27
* Implemented a predict API and its endpoint.

#### NEXT:
* Use model instead of simple response.
